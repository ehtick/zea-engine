## [3.2.0](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/compare/v3.0.1...v3.2.0) (2021-02-08)


### Features

* Added Color#addInPlace ([58a9953](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/58a99534e91ff20cefbb68c06173ea43f9a01fa8))
* CameraManipulator#setDefaultManipulationMode generates a useful error message if an invalid value is passed ([2cbde30](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/2cbde3026767a01c4660778b2b838288733bda8e))
* Due to a change in behavior in Chrome which caused a pause launching the renderer, xrCompatible is now set to false by default. The GL canvas is converted to an XR canvas when an XR device is detected, so no change in behavior should be noticed. ([e5f1ee0](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/e5f1ee00b6b5165b02a7d55e0df8cb5558eb3da2))
* GLShader now generates far nicer formatted error messages. No longer dumping out the entire GLSL code for the shader, instead just the culprit line and a few surrounding lines. ([d8b219b](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/d8b219b223833dfed1e3484afa8f637d63a19959))
* As geometries are streamed, the bounding box for the tree is now valid as we pre-load the bounding boxes for the geometries into the tree. ([9017f08](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/9017f08141eed2c84c23e87d60fbbf93ac584f43))
* CameraManipulator now calls 'setCapture' to avoid redundant geom data rendering during camera movements. ([6134bdd](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/6134bddd8c51f28eb149b7fb67101cda6f49e6e5))
* GridTreeItem is now exported for use outside the engine. ([9a5bfc7](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/9a5bfc72e0f25e822fbe21a0b120fe07bfdec41f))
* Draw shaders now support debugging of geom Id to verify how effective instancing has been. ([5b87975](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/5b87975b2031a39345d25b7a1baa23bba23b400c))
* Pointer events are now emitted from the VRViewport based on interactions with VR controller ([426a153](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/426a153c7c748efec022a0b56649c7b6c2f65e6e))

* Implemented a 1D Allocator for managing 2d arrays packed into a single 1D Array. ([b37bcca](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/b37bccaf2212b4829c32f3b07c32e5354c123a22))
* Initializing VR Stage below the active viewport position. ([ac6c5f2](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/ac6c5f2ab2f56ccc928d37528d6282be5c09f22e))
* Material now tracks state to check if a a texture has been assigned, or if it has become transparent. ([7914eac](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/7914eacff2c47ca990a04418da35e9bc48221717))
* Multi-draw pipeline now supports lines and points, and also non-32bit attr values. ([0553692](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/055369255d2284e94e8455019cd8b30fb5143780))
* Resizing a GLFbo now causes its bound color texture to be resized. ([29359c3](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/29359c3dd4578927f6740d8ed9498671a1b2e6a0))
* Resource loader now supports loading binary files via a new plugin ([#309](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/issues/309)) ([adc5f1c](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/adc5f1c1012ff1b9a84b2a49b0cf4f9fd718f015))


### Bug Fixes

* Cloning NumberParameter or MaterialFloatParam now properly clones the range and step values. ([ad4eefd](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/ad4eefd0d98ddd00ebd44665ce7910290c5d3a3c))
* Labels are now lazily updated on the next draw, instead of waiting on a timeout. This means we should no longer have frames where labels disappear/reappear. ([740d42c](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/740d42c78d25c907ac9add392276b2ad9ad568d6))
* PointGrid was not correctly generating its geometry after changes to procedural geometries in the previous release.([70e7c46](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/70e7c460d8f1637cdfc3af4848d72f7ffe2a1672))
* Cleaned up regressions in the VRViewTool for VR navigation([fe3b656](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/fe3b656e5af0c84c9afbf02ec7ab5ad98c701b9a))
* CameraManipulator WASD walk keys were left on when the mouse left the viewport. ([5edd614](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/5edd6140e69b6e5ca31862d19164419d20dab9ea))
* VLAAsset was not correctly reporting progress when loading streaming geoms. ([9c828c3](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/9c828c3ac1d3e43ebaabeec12763fc58811c2c82))
* ObjAsset was not able to correctly load objects made up of groups. ([ef1d92b](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/ef1d92b50062538af67d1b86207ff38ff43b8e1f))
* Viewports can now be initialized after the scene is already assigned to the renderer. Needed for XRViewports. ([a6fbb5c](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/a6fbb5cdd09d0397af120e94acd7ce5ffd8772a4))
