WebGL2 and WebWorkers now have widespread support (WebGL2 is now supported in Safari as of September 2021); however, WebXR, a library still in development, is not supported as widely. So if you are interested in having your web app work with VR/AR headsets, it's important to check your targeted browsers for compatibility.
