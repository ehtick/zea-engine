# Concept Title
[//]: <> (Concept titles start with a Noun and should be relatively short "Groups" is a valid title, "Working with Groups" is not.)
Create a short high level description of the concept. Try to answer as many of the 5Ws as applicable.
- What is the concept
- Why does the concept exist
- When should a programmer use the concept
- Where should a programmer use the concept
- Who shoud use the concept (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)

Shortdesc Example: Groups are made up of objects from the assembly tree. Adding objects to groups makes it easier to apply rules, events, transformations, etc. to many objects at once instead of individually. Use groups when you plan to call upon the same objects repeatedly in your project. Groups can be used in any project, but are most usefull for larger more complex projects. Groups are a basic feature and don't require any advanced knowledge to use.

[//]: <> (There shouldn't be any examples here beyond explaining what a group is. For live demos, how-tos, and other examples we will refer users to How-Tos. For example, how to make a group of CAD Assets, How-to make a group of Points, How to make a group of CAD and Points ... etc. We will talk about use cases later.)

## Concept Diagram

[//]: <> (Create a diagram (line drawing) that illustrates where this concept fits into the engine and how it relates to other concepts. This can be a large image - full page style cheat sheet some somebody might print out. Think about inputs and outputs maybe? see:https://cadexchanger.com/download/sdk/doc/dev/html/sdk_vis_architecture.html)

## System Description

[//]: <> (Describe how it works)



## How Can I Apply This Concept?
The following are the most common applications for this concept. Sure, many more exist, but we feel that if you master these, nothing will get in your way!

### Using [Concept Title] to [Objective]

[//]: <> (Excerpt taken from Groups Concept - add as many use cases as necessary to support client requests. Delete the below example and write your own.)

### Using Groups to Control Movement
Imaging you have a colection of geometries that are intended to move together. For example, a plastic casing with a collection of metal screws. You can create a group that contains the casing and screws, and then move the group using a kinematic operator like the gears or explode operator.

### Nomenclature

[//]: <> (Clarify any terms used in the system description - we will create a glossary or lexicon at some point)
