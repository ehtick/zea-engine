# Recommended Web Development Tools
You'll need to have these recommended applications (or an equivalent) running on your local machine.

## Code Editor
You will need a code editor to create your solution. Zea recommends using Visual Studio.

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

## Code Version-Control System
You will need a version-controlled environment for your development. You will also need to run Git Bash to locally host previews of your web development projects.

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## JavaScript Package Manager
Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.
