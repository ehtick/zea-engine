# Web Development Tools
You'll need to have these recommended applications (or an equivalent) running on your local machine.

### Code Editor
You will need a code editor to create your solution. Zea recommends using Visual Studio.

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

### Code Version-Control System
You will need a version-controlled environment for your development. You will also need to run Git Bash to locally host previews of your web development projects.

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
