# About the Zea Engine
In a nutshell, the Zea Engine is designed for innovative manufacturers and industry 4.0 supporters who aren't happy with the available solutions to leverage 3D models on the web.

Our product is a web-based 3D rendering engine designed from the ground up for CAD, all our analysis confirm that our rendering engine provides the best in class power, speed, and reach of any solution on the market today. 

Contrary to 3D engines built for video games, we don't need to prepare and optimize CAD geometry before loading it into our web-based engine which streamlines the process and makes the final product easily shareable with a URL, much like [this one](https://zea.live/GearBoxDemo/).
