# About the Zea Engine

The Zea Engine is for innovative manufacturers and industry 4.0 supporters who need to build web applications.

Zea Engine is a web-based 3D rendering solution designed from the ground up for CAD and professional graphics. Zea Engine provides best in class power, speed, and reach for the next generation of web applications.

Contrary to 3D engines built for video games, we don't need to prepare and optimize CAD geometry before loading it into our web-based engine which streamlines the process and makes the final product easily shareable with a URL, much like [this one](https://zea.live/GearBoxDemo/).

If it's your first time using the engine, make sure you have the [Recommended Web Development Tools](getting-started/development-setup.md) installed on your local machine.
