# About the Zea Engine

The Zea Engine is for innovative manufacturers and industry 4.0 supporters who need to build web applications.

Zea Engine is a web-based 3D rendering solution designed from the ground up for CAD and professional graphics. Zea Engine provides the best in class power, speed, and reach for the next generation of web applications.

## Power

The Zea Engine was designed with the highest requirements in mind, giving developers a suite of tools to address the toughest challenges in modern professional graphics app development. Zea Engine pushes the limits of what a developer can achieve in the browser by focusing on power and performance.

## Versatility

No single solution can solve all problems out of the box. Therefore, the Zea Engine uses a modular architecture that enables developers to integrate new functionalities. Zea keeps the essential features in the core while allowing powerful extensions to be built, either by Zea, to expand the engine's scope, or by third parties who wish to develop specific solutions.

## Reach

Applications that leverage the web browser are already available on all modern devices. These web applications provide a friction-free and straightforward way to deliver content without requiring users to install a player. Zea Engine is designed for the web and enables new categories of high performance and versatile web applications. 

## Getting Started

To gain a deeper understanding of the engine, please read the [Architecture Overview](arch-overview.md).

If you are new to web development, make sure to read the [Recommended Web Development Tools](getting-started/development-setup.md) to get setup.

If it's your first time using the engine, make sure you read the [Getting Started Using the Engine](getting-started/get-started-with-engine.md) to learn how to work with the engine.

If you are primarily interested in working with CAD data, you can find information on the Zea CAD Plugin on the [Plugins and Tools](plugins-and-tools.md) page.
