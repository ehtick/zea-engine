# About the Zea Engine

The Zea Engine is for innovative manufacturers and industry 4.0 supporters who need to build web applications.

Zea Engine is a web-based 3D rendering solution designed from the ground up for CAD and professional graphics. Zea Engine provides best in class power, speed, and reach for the next generation of web applications.

## Power

The Zea Engine was designed with the highest requirements in mind, giving developers a suite of tools that can address the toughest challenges in modern professional graphics app development. By focussing on power and performance, Zea Engine pushes the limits of what a developer can achieve in the browser today.

## Versatility

No single solution can solve all problems out of the box, and so Zea Engine was designed around a modular architecture that enables new functionality to be seamlessly integrated. This streamlines the development of the engine, keeping only essential features in the core, while allowing powerful extension to be built, either by Zea to expand the scope of the engine, or by third parties who wish to develop solutions to problems not addressed by the

## Reach

Web applications leverage the the web browser, already available on all modern devices. Web applications provide a simple and friction free way to deliver content to your clients. The capabilities of web browsers is constantly evolving and so what is possible today in web applications is continuously improving. Zea Engine is designed for the modern web enabling a new categories of high performance and versatile web applications.

## Getting Started

To gain a deeper understanding of the engine and how it works, please read the [Architecture Overview](arch-overview.md).

If you are new to web development make sure to read the [Recommended Web Development Tools](getting-started/development-setup.md) to get setup.

If it's your first time using the engine, make sure you read the [Getting Started Using the Engine](getting-started/get-started-with-engine.md) to learn how to work with the engine.

If you are primarily interested in working with CAD data, you can find information on the Zea CAD Plugin on the [Plugins and Tools](plugins-and-tools.md) page.

## Licensing
