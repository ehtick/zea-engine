### BaseTool 
The BaseTool provides an interface you can implement to define your own mouse, keyboard, and touch event handlers.

A tool is a class that is delegated the handling of all user interaction events. The built-in {CameraManipulator}
class provides a default tool for moving the viewport camera.

You can define your own custom tool, and replace the default CameraManipulator like so.
```javascript
  const customManipulator = new MyCustomCameraManipulator()
  renderer.getViewport().setManipulator(customManipulator)
```

Each tool should provide handlers for the main types of events it will be responsible for handling.
These include mouse, keyboard, touch and VR events. Once a tool is installed on the viewport, the viewport
will start invoking the handler methods defined in the interface.
If the Tool handles an event, it should call stopPropagation on the event so the engine knows to stop the
propagation of the event to other classes.

> Note: VR Events are ann emulation of mouse events, generated by the engine, allowing custom tools to be used to provide various VR interactions.

**Events**
* **installChanged:** Triggered when the tool is installed or uninstalled.
* **activatedChanged:** Triggered when a tool is activated or deactivated.
